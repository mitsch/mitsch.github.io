    Ranges vs Iterators, two unsufficient abstractions
  </div>
  <div class="introducer">
    If you call yourself a more advanced C++ programmer, you should have come across iterators and the underlying
    concepts of iterators. If not, feel free to indulge yourself into iterators.

    Ok, let me explain you iterators in the fastest way possible. You know, pointers from C? A pointer stores the
    address of some value (or consecutive values) in the memory. This is by nature one of the most essential ideas
    in C. It allows to bind (aka refer, aka points to) values on the heap. It gives a unified interface to values
    regardless of living on the stack or the heap, and it allows for passing parameters to or from function calls
    by reference rather than by value. The list of techniques using pointers to goes on and gives C some real power
    in terms of memory and runtime efficiency.

    Now, let's look on the data structure of an array. In C, (non static) arrays can be represented by a pointer and
    an integral counter. Representations of a string goes actually so far to discard the integral counter and to
    indicate the end by a trailing zero value. Since arrays are in some way first citizen in C, many optimisations
    and library support are made for arrays.
