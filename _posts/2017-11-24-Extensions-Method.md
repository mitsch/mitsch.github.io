# A new kind of interface in C++

Interfaces are one of the most fundamental mechanism for programming languages. It allows to abstract over values and hence to reason. For Object-Oriented languages, inheritance is used as a mechanism of interfacing. In template-supported languages, you can use templated values or templated functions as a tool of interfacing. Regardless on the actual mechanism, interfacing gives you the ability to define behaviour depending on some context. Contrary to parameters, this kind of dependency is broader.
