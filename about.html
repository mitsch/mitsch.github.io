              I am an engineer with Continental working on Artificial Intelligence.
              There are two topics I am focusing on: Computer Vision and MLOps. The work
              on Computer Vision resides more towards industrial research rather than
              particular products. With MLOps, I not only want to push the boundaries of
              how to effectively use software in our industrial research, but also scout
              bridges towards business products.

              I am a long-term enthusiast of certain programming languages, programming
              paradigms as well software engineering in general. With C and C++, I started
              to learn to program way back in high school. A third language, I came to
              love, is Haskell. My day-to-day work life put me in contact with various
              languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, Groovy or Bash. Lately, I dove
              in into the topic of MLOps, where I also started to look onto DevOps, Agile,
              people in our Industry as well, in particular, communication in our Industry.

              any kind of artistique level. Yet, I try my best every time. I want to take
              the opportunity to springle some results into my writings.
